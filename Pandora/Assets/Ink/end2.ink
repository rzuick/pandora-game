    The king ultimately chose a young woman who, while not traditionally beautiful, was beautiful and worthy in her actions. She released all who had been held captive by the king and entrusted them with a solemn duty: to go out into the kingdom and teach the value of kindness, compassion, and good. 
    You became one of her most ardent supporters, determined to make your next voyage in the world one full of hope and wonder.
